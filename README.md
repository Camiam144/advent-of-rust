# ADVENT OF RUST

Learning rust by doing advent of code in rust. Either porting old python solutions for whichever exist in https://github.com/Camiam144/advent-of-code or making new rust solutions for ones that don't overlap.

Trying to learn how to write better rust code. Some of this is going to look like a self taught python programmer wrote it. There's a reason for that.

Some basic scaffolding included, shamelessly ~~stolen~~ inspired from a variety of other pre-existing scaffolding solutions and built into something I understand, enjoy using, and suits my needs. No automatic downloading of puzzle inputs yet, but maybe in the future.

No LLM generated code in this repo, all mistakes are happily my own.
